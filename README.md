# EA
Enterprise Architecture Final Project

# Goal:
The goal of this project is to give hands on practical experience with building an application using the technologies we have been discussing during the last 3 weeks.
The topic is open as long as it relates to the material of the course.

# Working as a team:
Students will work together to create the project in groups. But students should be aware that everyone still has to give their own presentation; there are no ‘team together’ presentations, although I do ask that members of a team present consecutively (no gaps / other people in between).
Every member must take responsibility for a segment of the application (a vertical slice). Meaning the person will have to be responsible of the persistence, business logic and presentation layers of the section that person will present.
All the projects are expected to include Spring Security.

# Grading
Going above and beyond the areas of Spring and Hibernate discussed in the class will be rewarded, for example adding JTA, Testing or internationalization (I18N). Spending a lot of time on non-related topics such as nice HTML and CSS will not be rewarded. Your project will primarily be graded on functionality in the following areas:
 
# Hibernate
30%
Additional areas of Hibernate not discussed, or only discussed lightly are added

# Spring:
30%
Additional areas of Spring not discussed, or only discussed lightly are added

#Integration
30%
Additional other integration technologies are present (web service, RMI, JSM, JTA with multiple DBs)

#Presentation
10%
Not only was it structured and clear, it was engaging / fun.
